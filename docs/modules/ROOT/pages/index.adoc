= Docker Swarm Runbooks

Formulaic has produced a set of runbooks to help setup and administer
a {swarm} instance.

== Features

* Runbooks powered by {jupyter}
** High-level scripts written in Python 3
** Provides visibility into scripts
** Can run runbooks step-by-step
** Produces a committable log of changes

* Data stored in YAML (secured by {sops} and {age})
** Easy to browse infrastructure information
** Configurable security for sensitive information

== Documentation

We have split documentation into two main categories.

The first section ("Administration") covers the initial steps
needed to clone and setup the runbooks with encryption keys
and credentials/configuration for cloud providers.

The section section ("Usage") covers all remaining runbooks,
which are focused on day-to-day Swarm tasks, which will depend
on the initial administration being complete first.
