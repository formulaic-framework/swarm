= Organizing Runbooks

Inside the runbook repository, each operation is provided as a runbook inside the `runbooks/` directory.

We recommend copying each runbook into a `history/` directory as you run it,
and commit each runbook including the output of each script.

This will provide a viewable history of each action that has been taken in the swarm.
