= Import age Key

You can import an {age} key that you already have.

Copy the `age-add-existing-key` runbook,
and run it.

You will be prompted for three items:

name::
You should specify a name/alias for the key.
You may wish to use some alias like `"ci"`, or enter something like your username.

public key::
Enter your {age} public key, which should start `age`

groups::
Enter a list of groups that this key will be able to decrypt, comma separated.
The default SOPS configuration uses `"ops"` as a group that can access all sensitive information.
