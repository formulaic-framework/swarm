= Disable SOPS Encryption

If you do not wish to hide any properties, you should still complete the {sops} setup,
so that scripts can call SOPS commands without errors.

However, you can tweak the SOPS configuration to ensure that all data is still visible.

== Update Template

You will need to update the `.sops.yaml.j2` template.

Change each instance of `encrypted_regex` to a pattern that will not match any properties,
e.g. `key_never_used\{10}`.

.Example `.sops.yaml.j2`
[source,yml]
----
creation_rules:
  - path_regex: swarm.yml
    age: "{{ops}}"
    encrypted_regex: 'key_never_used{10}'
----

You will need to xref:sops/init.adoc[update the SOPS configuration file] after changing
the file for the changes to be used.
